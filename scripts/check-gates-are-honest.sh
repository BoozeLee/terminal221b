# Refuse a gate that reports a clean pass when it could not look at anything.
#
# The other gates in this repository check the repository. This one checks the
# gates, and it does so by driving them rather than by reading them, because
# reading a gate cannot tell you what it does when it is given nothing. A gate
# that reports "clean" for a repository it never scanned produces a line in a CI
# log that is indistinguishable from a gate that passed, and that is the most
# expensive kind of bug: nothing in a diff says so.
#
# The check is *differentiation*, not merely "did not exit 0". Each registered
# gate is driven against three fixtures and has to be distinguished across all
# three:
#
#   clean        exit 0   every subject was read, nothing found
#   dirty        exit 1   a subject was read and it is wrong
#   unlookable   exit 2   a subject could not be read, or there was none
#
# Requiring all three is what stops the cheap fix from being "always exit 2". A
# gate that returns 2 for everything satisfies "never reports a false green" and
# is useless; the clean fixture rejects it. A gate that returns 0 for everything
# is the bug this file exists to find; the unlookable fixture rejects it.
#
# Gates register in `.gate-manifest`, one line each:
#
#   <subject-kind> <gate-command>
#
# The subject kind selects a fixture builder. An unknown kind is a finding, not
# something to skip: it forces whoever adds a gate to answer "what does this look
# at, and what does it look like when there is nothing?", which is the question
# this file exists to make unavoidable.
#

#   check-gates-are-honest.sh [repo-dir]   audit the registered gates

# identifier gate does not look there at all. A fixture holding only a home path
# therefore satisfies the first and reports 0 for the second, and the meta-gate
# would refuse a gate that is behaving correctly.
#
# The meta-gate is asserting the *contract* -- clean, finding, unlookable -- and
# not the gate's coverage. Coverage is the gate's own self-test's job, and both
# of these gates already carry controls proving they catch their own classes. So

  # The direction that actually bites in practice: a gate that is still being run
  # but has fallen out of the manifest. Its output is still believed, and nothing
  # has ever asked whether it can distinguish a pass from a blank.
  #
  # Two things this has to get right, and one of them it did not. The runner is
  # reset to the honest gate first, because the previous control left its own
  # gate in the runner array -- and an unregistered gate is *also* what that
  # leftover produces, so the control passed while its own fixture contributed
  # nothing. And the extra gate has to be added as a real entry inside
  # `gate_cmds`, which is the only form the reverse check reads. Appending a
  # manifest-shaped line to a runner is neither valid bash nor an array element:
  # it is a bare command after the array has been closed, and the audit would
  # have walked straight past it. Proven by disabling the reverse check and
  # watching this control go red.
