 * The report is a contract between two implementations: this file writes it and
 * `packages/rust-tui/src/dossier.rs` reads it. A field renamed on one side and
 * not the other is the same failure as F22, where the crypto clause set drifted
 * between the CLI and the TUI — except here the drift would be silent, because
 * a Rust struct with a missing field simply stops reading that value.
 *
 * So two tests do the work. One pins the markdown renderer, which is the
 * operator-facing output that already existed and must not move. The other reads
 * the Rust source and asserts every field it declares is a key this side
 * actually emits, in both directions, and fails if either list is empty.
